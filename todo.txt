maybe it is more efficient to store physical magnitudes as a magnitude and a
unit vector. This would allow defining magnitude() for any value of N, would
simplify multiplication with scalars and would eliminate many calls to
vectorl2_norm(physical_vector). It would require slightly more memory for some
values of N (mass is a scalar, so padding would sometimes compensate maybe), and
keeping the unit vector invariant would be more expensive for some computations.
This could then be improved again by introducing expression templates, as it
would minimize the number of vector normalizations to one per computation, if at
least one operation maps a vector out of its span.
