the naming convention is 
	snake_case for functions, clases and variables for consistency with the stl
	PascalCase for enums and enum structs
	Wahtever_Is_This_Case for multiword template parameters
member variables are preceded by m_
static member variables are preceded by s_
for pointers use
	*x to dereference instead of * x
	(T*)x to cast instead of (T *)x
	T* f() for return types instead of T *()
for references use
	T& x instead of T & x
prefer east const for references and pointers
	T const& instead of const T&
	T const* const instead of const T *const (because if you read backwards it is correct. Constant ptr to constant int)
	T const* instead of const T * (because if you read backwards it is correct. Ptr to constant int)
	T* const instead of T *const (because if you read backwards it is correct. Constant ptr to int)
