No te rayes q si te lleva mucho te ayudo, pero creo q se hace rapido

float and double need to be tested, this one is important
particles should have an initila velocity (maybe biased to be perpendicualr to
the radius so orbits form)
brute force function evaluations are known from parameters. Check
sensible bounds for barnes hut function evaluations can be estimated from parameters,
specially size, iterations and approximating distance Estimaet and check
solvers need to be tested
tree should be tested briefly, some internal checks ensure some corrctness
cache simulation results to make testing faster
reals resuls can also be used to check much better
test larger simulations
test 2 particle simulations for stability, bounds are known
physical interaction error depends on epsilon
Tolerance when comparing brute force and barnes hut should be normalized by the
value of G
